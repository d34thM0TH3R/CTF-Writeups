# Warnings

Allow of these files will trip native virus detection in Windows.  

The [PCAP](intercepted.pcap) contains a payload of some "malware". 

Libemu2 has a basic x86 emulator, and works similarly to some malware. You need both of these files.  
[libemu2 dev file](libemu-dev_0.2.0+git20120122-1.2build1_amd64.deb)
[libemu2 build file](libemu2_0.2.0+git20120122-1.2build1_amd64.deb)

All files are SAFE to use in a Kali system.
