# basic-file-exploitation

## Problem Description
Author: Will Hong  
Description

The program provided allows you to write to a file and read what you wrote from it. Try playing around with it and see if you can break it!  
Connect to the program with netcat:  
$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52681 **   
The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/543/program-redacted.c).  

## Write Up

The provided file `program-redacted.c` contains the code running on the server.  
The function which will display the flag is below.
```
static void data_read() {
  char entry[4];
  long entry_number;
  char output[100];
  int r;

  memset(output, '\0', 100);
  
  printf("Please enter the entry number of your data:\n");
  r = tgetinput(entry, 4);
  // Timeout on user input
  if(r == -3)
  {
    printf("Goodbye!\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  
  if ((entry_number = strtol(entry, NULL, 10)) == 0) {
    puts(flag);
    fseek(stdin, 0, SEEK_END);
    exit(0);
  }

  entry_number--;
  strncpy(output, data[entry_number], input_lengths[entry_number]);
  puts(output);
}
```

The flag will be displayed if `entry_number` is 0.
The `data_read()` function cannot be called until the database has been populated with at least 1 entry.  
Combining the database being filled and exploiting the program is shown below.

```
Hi, welcome to my echo chamber!
Type '1' to enter a phrase into our database
Type '2' to echo a phrase in our database
Type '3' to exit the program
1
Please enter your data:
1
Please enter the length of your data:
1
Your entry number is: 1
Write successful, would you like to do anything else?
2
Please enter the entry number of your data:
0
[REDACTED]
```
This will cause the program to print the flag and exit.
