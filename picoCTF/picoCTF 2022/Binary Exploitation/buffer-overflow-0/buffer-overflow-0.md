# buffer-overflow-0

## Problem Description
AUTHOR: ALEX FULTON / PALASH OSWAL  

Description  
Smash the stack  
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer?  
The program is available [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/520/vuln).  
You can view source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/520/vuln.c).  
And connect with it using:  
nc saturn.picoctf.net 53935 **  


## Write Up

The provided file `vuln.c` contains the C code running on the server, and the file `vuln` contains an executable version of the program.  
The 2 important parts of the code are the vuln and main functions, as can be seen below.  
```
void vuln(char *input){
  char buf2[16];
  strcpy(buf2, input);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){
  
  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                    "own debugging flag.\n");
    exit(0);
  }
  
  fgets(flag,FLAGSIZE_MAX,f);
  signal(SIGSEGV, sigsegv_handler); // Set up signal handler
  
  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);


  printf("Input: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  char buf1[100];
  gets(buf1); 
  vuln(buf1);
  printf("The program will exit now\n");
  return 0;
}
```
The program gets input of length 100 from the user, without validating its length.  
It then passes the buffer to the `vuln` function.  
The `vuln` function creates a buffer of length 16, and then copies the original buffer to itself using `strcpy`, which does not check for length.  
If the user input is long enough to cause a buffer overflow the flag will be displayed.  
This can be done by passing a value of 16 chars and then several more for good measure.  
This can be seen below.  

```
Input: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[REDACTED]
```
This will cause the program to print the flag and exit.
